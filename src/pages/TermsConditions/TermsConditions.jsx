                An integral aspect of InstantKaj’s rating system is the Feedback
                Ratings given by employees after finishing a work. Feedback
                demonstrates the general experience of the employer with
                freelancers and their operation. Employers are advised to notify
                the freelancer of any issues faced during their successful order
                with respect to the freelancer’s operation.
              </li>
              <li>
                Leaving an employer’s feedback is an employer’s inherent
                prerogative. If there are explicit breaches of our terms and
                conditions, input scores will not be deleted.
              </li>
              <li>
                All feedback ratings must come from legal transactions carried
                out exclusively via the InstantKaj platform from users within
                our Group to avoid any abuse of our Feedback framework. A
                permanent suspension of all relevant accounts would result in
                transactions coordinated, determined to artificially boost
                freelancer scores or to misuse the InstantKaj site with
                purchases from additional accounts.
